# CSC10008-Socket-Project
A client-server application that provides hotel-booking services

In this project, I was in charge of Back-end programming. My responsibilities were to:
  - Establish connection between client and server 
  - Implement threads
  - Design and build database
  - Implement a number of features including: sign-in, log-in, log-out, searching for available rooms, booking, and cancelling previously booked rooms.
  
As regards my teammate, Nguyễn Gia Bảo, he was taking charge of Front-end programming. Not only did he create the interface and other visual effects of the application, but he also contributed significantly to the algorithm optimization process. To be more detailed, he assisted in calculating date/time, extracting real time when seeking empty rooms, and fixing bugs in the cancelling booked rooms feature.
